# Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?
### Exploratory Data Analysis ‚Äì Module 5 Assignment

---

## Overview
This project analyzes the factors that influence whether a driver accepts a mobile coupon while driving, using the **UCI Machine Learning ‚ÄúIn-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation‚Äù dataset**.  
The dataset captures user demographics, travel context, weather, passenger type, time of day, and coupon type.  

Using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`), the analysis explores patterns that distinguish drivers who accept coupons from those who do not, focusing first on **bar coupons** and later extending to **independent variables** such as passenger type, weather, occupation, and income.

---

## Objectives
- Investigate how coupon acceptance varies with contextual and demographic factors.  
- Identify customer segments most likely to accept coupons.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for targeted marketing.

## üîπ Key Findings

### 1. Initial Bar Coupon Analysis
- Around **41%** of all bar coupons were accepted.  
- Among drivers who visit bars **more than once a month**, acceptance rose to **~73%**.  
- **Younger drivers (<30)** and those **without kids** had the highest acceptance.  
- Drivers who were **not widowed** and frequently went to bars showed significantly higher likelihood of accepting.  
- **Conclusion:** Drivers who are **younger, socially active, and regularly visit bars** are most responsive to bar coupon offers.

### 2. Independent Investigations

#### Passenger Analysis
- **With Friends:** Highest acceptance (~64%) ‚Üí social context increases likelihood.  
- **With Partner:** Moderate (~49%).  
- **Alone:** Lower (~38%).  
- **With Kids:** Lowest (~29%) ‚Üí family constraints reduce flexibility.  
**Insight:** Social passengers (friends/partners) encourage spontaneous decisions to redeem coupons.

#### Weather and Time Analysis
- **Sunny days:** Highest acceptance (~50‚Äì55%).  
- **Rainy days:** Lowest (~35‚Äì40%).  
- **Snowy:** Moderate (~44%).  
- Across all weather types, acceptance peaked around **2 PM** ‚Üí drivers are more open during midday travel.  
**Insight:** Drivers are more likely to accept coupons during **pleasant weather** and **daytime hours**.

#### Occupation and Income Analysis
- **Construction & Extraction**, **Healthcare**, **Personal Care & Service**, and **Students** show the **highest coupon acceptance** (often above 0.7).  
- **Farming**, **Protective Service**, and **High-income professions** show the **lowest acceptance** (<0.4).  
- Across all occupations, **lower-income groups (<$50K)** are much more likely to accept coupons.  
**Insight:** Coupon acceptance is highest among **service-based or student occupations** and **lower-income earners**, highlighting the influence of economic motivation.

## Visualizations
- Bar plots for:
  - Coupon type (Bar Coupons)  
  - Passenger type  
  - Weather & Time  
  - Occupation & Income  
- Histogram of temperature distribution  

All plots include clear labels, readable scales, and descriptive titles.

## Summary & Recommendations
- Focus marketing on **younger, social, and lower-income** drivers.  
- Send offers during **afternoon hours** and **good weather**.  
- Emphasize **service-sector and student audiences**, who demonstrate the highest acceptance levels.  
- Reduce spending on campaigns targeting **high-income professionals**, who show low responsiveness to small discounts.
